## Explanation on the Linguistic Structure of Turkish Numeral Expressions

### Introduction

The Turkish numeral system is simple but requires some suffixes in some contexts, making it slightly harder to combine. This report provides an overview of this structure.

### Basic Numerals in Turkish

The numerals in Turkish are dependent on whether they indicate the hour or the minutes. For hours, Turkish uses suffixes that assimilate with the words preceding them, which means there is no standard suffix applicable to all numbers. For minutes, the numerals are used without suffix. An example is "biri bir geçiyor" means "it is one minute past one", with "biri" meaning "one o'clock" and "bir" meaning "one minute".

- bir(-i) (1)
- iki(-yi) (2)
- üç(-ü) (3)
- dört(-dü) (4)
- beş(-i) (5)
- altı(-yı) (6)
- yedi(-yi) (7)
- sekiz(-i) (8)
- dokuz(-u) (9)
- on(-u) (10)

### Expression of Two-Digit Numbers

In Turkish, two-digit numbers are usually expressed by combining the tens with the numerals, like in English. For instance:

- 23: yirmi-üç (literally: "twenty-three")
- 47: kırk-yedi (literally: "fourty-seven")
- 55: elli-beş (literally: "fifty-five")

This logical progression allows for easy comprehension and quick calculations. Unlike English, which has special words like "eleven" or "twelve" for certain numbers, Turkish maintains the same system for all combinations of numerals.

### Expression of pre-determined intervals

Turkish also has a different order of pre-determined intervals, such as "quarter past" and "half past". To demonstrate this:

- 09:30 -> "dokuz buçuk" means (literally: "nine half"), also notice how there is no suffix for the hour in the case of half an hour.
- 13:15 -> "biri çeyrek geçiyor" (literally: "one o'clock quarter past")

Finally, there are cases that are not caught by our Talking Clock, such as:

- 09:45 -> "ona çeyrek kala" (literally: "ten o'clock quarter before")
- 13:32 -> "bir buçuğu iki geçiyor" (literally: "one o'clock half two past")

These were not considered because they can be considered edge cases and in usual speech it is more a formal manner of saying the same time without the special case.
