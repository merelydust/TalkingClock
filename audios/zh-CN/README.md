## Explanation on the Linguistic Structure of Chinese Numeral Expressions

### Introduction
The Chinese numeral system has a distinct and logical structure that contrasts with some Western numeral expressions. This report provides an overview of this structure, focusing on its simplicity and clarity.

### Basic Numerals in Chinese
- 一 (1)
- 二 (2)
- 三 (3)
- 四 (4)
- 五 (5)
- 六 (6)
- 七 (7)
- 八 (8)
- 九 (9)
- 十 (10)

### Expression of Two-Digit Numbers
In Chinese, two-digit numbers are usually expressed by combining the tens place with the units place. For instance:
- 23: 二十三 (literally: "two-ten-three")
- 47: 四十七 (literally: "four-ten-seven")
- 55: 五十五 (literally: "five-ten-five")

This logical progression allows for easy comprehension and quick calculations. Unlike English, which has special words like "eleven" or "twelve" for certain numbers, Chinese maintains a consistent structure.

### Expression of Larger Numbers
The Chinese numeral system extends this logical structure to even larger numbers. Here's how:
- 100: 一百 (literally: "one-hundred")
- 215: 二百一十五 (literally: "two-hundred-one-ten-five")
- 302: 三百零二 (literally: "three-hundred-zero-two")

Numbers in the hundreds are expressed similarly to those in the tens, albeit with the addition of "百" (hundred) as a place value. The consistent structure aids in simplifying both oral and written communication.

### Conclusion
The Chinese numeral expression system is straightforward, eschewing special terms for a consistent and logical structure based on place value. This structural simplicity not only reflects the linguistic characteristics of the Chinese language but also underscores the efficiency and logic inherent in its numeral system.
